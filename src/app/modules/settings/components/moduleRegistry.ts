/**
 * Plugin module registry for the Settings → Modules tab.
 *
 * Mirrors the feature set already listed in nav-schema.ts. Enable state
 * here is local UI-only state — toggling a module here doesn't persist or
 * filter the sidebar for any of them, including Subscriptions.
 *
 * Of these 9 entries, exactly one (Subscriptions, `OptionKeys::SUB_ENABLED`)
 * has a real backend enable/disable flag today — `Subscriptions\Module`
 * checks it before bootstrapping. It isn't wired to this toggle yet: that
 * flag would need to live behind a route that stays registered even when
 * the module is disabled (the Subscriptions REST controller itself only
 * registers when `is_enabled()` is true, so a settings route inside it
 * would vanish the moment someone disables the module from here — locking
 * re-enabling behind a direct DB edit). That's a routing-architecture
 * decision, not a wiring fix, so it's left undone rather than guessed at.
 *
 * Licensing, Updates, SaaS Provisioning, and Downloads have no enable/
 * disable flag anywhere in the backend — Plugin::init() bootstraps them
 * unconditionally. Affiliate Program, Abandoned Cart, and Security Suite
 * have no backend module at all (their pages are frontend-only stubs, see
 * AppRoutes.tsx's "Module stubs" imports); Analytics is a frontend
 * aggregation view, not a bootstrapped module. Every toggle below is
 * decorative until that changes.

 * @since 1.0.0
